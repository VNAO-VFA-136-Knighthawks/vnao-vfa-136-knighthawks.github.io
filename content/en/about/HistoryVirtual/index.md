## September 2023
The Knighthawks squadron within VNAO was founded in September 2023. After the deestablishment of VNAO's Carrier Air Wing 14 (CVW-14) in August 2023, several pilots from CVW-14 transfered to the newly created squadron under the command of CVW-7.

For VFA-136 leadership, Blade is appointed Commanding Officer (CO) with Mumbles as Executive Officer (XO).
