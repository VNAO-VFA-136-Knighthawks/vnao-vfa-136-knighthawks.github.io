   Learn about our principles that guide how we operate and work together

The DCS community is huge, with countless groups and organisations catering for all kinds of virtual pilots. Whether you fit into one of these groups depends on many factors. Here we'd like to give you an idea of our principles, how we enjoy flight simulation and what we focus on.  

### We aim for realism in procedures and tactics.
We are fascinated by the world of military aviation, especially naval aviation. Many naval aviation procedures are well documented and publicly available. We strive to learn and follow these procedures whenever possible. For tactics that we use in a simulated combat environment, it is rare to find real-life documents. These are usually classified for very good reasons. This is where we try to come up with sensible tactics on our own. However, we do not consider ourselves a milsim group, and we do not have ranks other than CO and XO for squadron leadership.

### We are eager to learn and to teach what we've learned.
With our hobby of Flight Simulation, we partially mimic the full time job of professional military pilots. There is so much to learn and so much to do in the limited time we have to devote to our hobby. What we have in common is a willingness to learn and refine our skills. The step from student to teacher is a small one. We encourage all members to share their knowledge and experience. Helping people to delve deeper into the world of military flight simulation is an obligation we gladly accept.

### We know that real life comes first.
Most of us have jobs, families, or other real-life responsibilities that we want and need to attend to. There is no happy virtual piloting if your real life is in disarray. So we know that real life comes first, and there are times when real life needs your attention more than the virtual world. All we ask is that you tell us, and we will be understanding.

### We encourage but we don't enforce, it's a hobby after all.
Our group changes regularly as new people join and others leave for various reasons. We are always striving to get better at what we do, and we encourage everyone in our group to join us in this endeavor. How fast you progress depends mostly on how much time you can devote to this hobby, whether it be flying, studying flight-related documents or watching YouTube tutorials. But we realize that we all have our own personal preferences about how much realism we want to emulate. When working together, we need to find common ground and agree on standards.  However, what you do in your virtual cockpit (for example, whether you use checklists or not) is up to you.
