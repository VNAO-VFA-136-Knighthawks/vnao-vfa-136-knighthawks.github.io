## Getting on board

Joining VNAO is very easy. Just visit our [VNAO Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3uMcCJynu6) You can either lurk for a while or just say hello in one of the text or voice channels. There are always friendly people there to help you get started, but it might help if you provide the following information
 - What aircraft are you flying?
 - Where are you from, what time zone are you in?
 - Your experience level with DCS / the aircraft

If you're welcome to join (rarely are people not welcome), and if you're ready, you'll be assigned the appropriate Discord roles. You will begin your qualification process as a VT, which is a member of a VT Training Squadron. You'll have access to additional Discord channels. You'll be enrolled in the training program. In preparation for your initial carrier qualification, you'll be given a curriculum to work through. 

## Carrier Qualification

Each month, we hold a carrier qualification event where VTs can show that they are ready to take the next step. During the qualification sortie the following requirements must be met:
 
- Cold start your aircraft from the ramp
- Navigate to an assigned waypoint
- Aerial Refueling Operations to include bearing-line formation rejoins
- Parade and Cruise Formations
- Case I Recovery Procedures
	- marshal stack operations
	- carrier break
	- six graded carrier landings with a minimum of a 50% boarding rate and an average score of 2.5

Sounds challenging? It is, but other pilots in the VNAO will help you prepare for the CQ event. And after a mandatory checkride before the CQ event, you'll know if you're ready.

## FRS Phase
After passing your initial carrier qualification, you'll join an FRS squadron. The syllabus there is designed to prepare you for a smoother transition into a VNAO squadron. 

## Joining a fleet squadron
Upon completion of FRS training, you will finally join one of VNAO's active fleet squadrons. Be prepared to welcome a new callsign that will be given to you by your new squadron mates.

## Staying on Board 
In order to stay on board, you must be an active member. Currently, the only requirement is to have at least four traps on the carrier per month. We encourage everyone to contribute their knowledge and skills to help the community, be it as a mission designer, skin artist, or whatever you are (or want to be) good at.
