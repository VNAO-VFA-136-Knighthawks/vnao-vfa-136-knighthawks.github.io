## Getting on board

Joining VNAO is very easy. Just visit our [VNAO Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3uMcCJynu6) You can either lurk for a while or just say hello in one of the text or voice channels. There are always friendly people there to help you get started, but it might help if you provide the following information
 - What aircraft are you flying?
 - Where are you from, what time zone are you in?
 - Your experience level with DCS / the aircraft

If you're welcome to join (rarely are people not welcome), and if you're ready, you'll be assigned the appropriate Discord roles. You will start your qualification process as a VT, which is a member of the VT Training Squadron. You'll have access to more Discord channels and our basic training materials.  

## The Qualification Process

You'll be a VT for at least 30 days. During this time, we can get to know each other and see if VNAO is the right place for you. You will also want to prepare for your first Carrier Qualification (CQ) event that we hold each month. After passing the CQ, you'll become a member of one of VNAO's squadrons. During the qualification sortie the following requirements must be met:
 
- Cold start your aircraft from the ramp
- Navigate to an assigned waypoint
- Aerial Refueling Operations to include bearing-line formation rejoins
- Parade and Cruise Formations
- Case I Recovery Procedures
	- marshal stack operations
	- carrier break
	- six graded carrier landings with a minimum of a 50% boarding rate and an average score of 2.5

Sounds challenging? It is, but other pilots in the VNAO will help you prepare for the CQ event. And after a mandatory checkride before the CQ event, you'll know if you're ready.

## Staying on Board 
In order to stay on board, you must be an active member. Currently, the only requirement is to have at least four traps on the carrier per month. We encourage everyone to contribute their knowledge and skills to help the community, be it as a mission designer, skin artist, or whatever you are (or want to be) good at.
