From our experience, those recommendations are optimistic. A system according to these specs will get you started, but there is much room for improvement (and much more money to spend).

### Joystick & other peripherals
Sometimes people show up that fly with a game controller or even the keyboard. Please don't be one of them. It's just not possible become a proficient squadron member without a minimum invest in proper flight sim gear.

Your equipment will also influence your level of immersion.

We don't want to recommend specific products here, but the following list should give you an idea about different levels of investment:

* **Beginner** - you are just trying this
	* Joystick with additional throttle axis - that'll let you see if you like the virtual flying experience
	* Gaming Headset (cable) - so that you can communicate with other virtual pilots

* **Intermediate** - you want to fly with others, to learn and have fun
  * Simple HOTAS (stick and separate throttle) with more buttons, axes,...
  * Head tracker - move your head to look around in the virtual world
  * Big screen
  * Second screen
  
 * **Enthusiast** - yes, THAT is my hobby
   * VR-Headset
   * Rudder pedals
   * Hardware cockpit panels and displays
   * Gaming Headset (wireless)
 
 * **Nerd** - Living the dream...
   * High-end PC, high-end VR-gear
   * 6 DOF motion platform
   * flight suit and helmet
   * oxygen bottle and mask ;-)

## Software

### DCS - Digital Combat Simulatior

{{% /imgproc %}}
The base game of DCS is for free and lets to fly the Russian Sukhoi Su-25T ground attack aircraft and the TF-51D Mustang, a World War II fighter. Those airplanes are rather low-fidelity aircraft. They lack clickable cockpit controls and a sophisticated flight model. Nevertheless, they are a good starting point and easier to learn than their high-fidelity counterparts. As terrains, the Caucasus region and the Marianas in the Pacific Ocean are free maps where you can fly on. In general, you can fly both single player, keeping everything to your PC or in multiplayer, where you connect to an online server with other players.

DCS World can be downloaded on the [Eagle Dynamics page.](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/downloads/world/). We recommend to download the Open Beta version that contains the newest features. Most DCS online communities use this version. It is also available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223750/DCS_World_Steam_Edition/).

You can purchase additional modules, e.g. aircraft, terrains, campaigns. If you want to become a member of VNAO, there are required and recommended modules as follows:
 * Required, no way around It
    * F/A-18C Hornet or F-14 Tomcat or any other module that is US-Navy related.
	* Supercarrier
 * Highly recommended
   * all maps/terrains except Normandy 1 and 2, Channel Map and South Atlantic. 

### SRS - Simple Radio Standalone

[SRS - Simple Radio Standalone](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-SimpleRadioStandalone)  is a separate tool for voice communication between players. It simulates different effects of radio transmissions, both encrypted und unencrypted. Maybe, the newly develped DCS-internal voice chat will replace SRS, but for now, it's a must have.

### Discord

Our [Discord](https://discord.com/) server is the place where we meet. Discord is a social platform that offers instant messaging, voice chats, content streaming and much more. It's available via browser and as a standalone application. You have a question, you want to talk to your squadron mates, you want to arrange for a training session? Everything is done on Discord. So no way around it. As soon as you are registered with Discord, you might want to check out our [VNAO Discord server.](https://discord.gg/3uMcCJynu6)

### OMM - Open Mod Manager

VNAO runs different DCS servers that provide training or combat environments in different theaters of the world. Those servers also utilize different DCS modules ("mods"), that have been created by third-party programmers and not Eagle Dynamics itself. Installing and managing these mods can be tedious, so we're using a tool called [Open Mod Manager.](https://github.com/sedenion/OpenModMan)

OMM can connect to online mod repositories, where all the required mods are stored and updated in case newer versions are released. VNAO hosts a mod repository for its members, so you'll be given access once you've decided to join.
